//java garbage collection \
//Garbage Collection is process of reclaiming the runtime unused memory automatically.
//In other words, it is a way to destroy the unused objects.
//It makes java memory efficient because garbage collector removes the unreferenced objects from heap memory.
//It is automatically done by the garbage collector(a part of JVM) so we don't need to make extra efforts.
